# WGSAM 2020 Agenda

WGSAM will be held online and by correspondense in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Meeting plenary sessions will be for 2 hours each day, 3-5 pm Central Europe, 2-4 pm Western Europe, 9-11 am US East Coast. 

For some participants these times are well outside normal work hours (6-8 am on the US West Coast and 2-4 am in New Zealand). Sarah is happy to meet separately later in the day with interested members from those time zones to get your input on issues discussed earlier in the day; please contact Sarah at <Sarah.Gaichas@noaa.gov> if this is of interest and we can set something up.
