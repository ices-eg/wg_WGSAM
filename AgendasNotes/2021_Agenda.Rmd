## WGSAM Terms of Reference (ToRs), 2019-2021

ToR a, Regional updates: **Review further progress and deliver key updates on multispecies modelling and ecosystem data analysis contributing to modeling throughout the ICES region**

ToR b, Key-runs:  **Update of key-runs (standardized model runs updated with recent data) of multispecies and ecosystem models for different ICES regions**

ToR c, Skill assessment: **Establish and apply methods to assess the skill of multispecies models intended for operational advice**

ToR d, Multi-model advice: **Evaluate methods for generating advice by comparing and/or combining multiple models**

ToR e, MSE: **Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) methods and applications for mutispecies and ecosystem advice, including evaluating management procedures and estimating biological reference points**

# WGSAM 2021 Agenda

WGSAM will be held online and by correspondence in 2021 due to the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meeting plenary sessions will be for 2 hours each day, 3-5 pm Central Europe, 2-4 pm Western Europe, 9-11 am US East Coast.

If necessary, meetings may extend outside these times to finish work and discussions. We will update the group with any changes.
