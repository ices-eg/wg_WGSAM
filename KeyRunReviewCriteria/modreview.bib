	abstract = {Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a statistical postprocessing technique that has been used in probabilistic weather forecasting to calibrate forecast ensembles and generate predictive probability density functions (PDFs) for weather quantities. The authors apply BMA to probabilistic visibility forecasting using a predictive PDF that is a mixture of discrete point mass and beta distribution components. Three approaches to developing predictive PDFs for visibility are developed, each using BMA to postprocess an ensemble of visibility forecasts. In the ﬁrst approach, the ensemble is generated by a translation algorithm that converts predicted concentrations of hydrometeorological variables into visibility. The second approach augments the raw ensemble visibility forecasts with model forecasts of relative humidity and quantitative precipitation. In the third approach, the ensemble members are generated from relative humidity and precipitation alone. These methods are applied to 12-h ensemble forecasts from 2007 to 2008 and are tested against verifying observations recorded at Automated Surface Observing Stations in the Paciﬁc Northwest. Each of the three methods produces predictive PDFs that are calibrated and sharp with respect to both climatology and the raw ensemble.},

	abstract = {Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-conﬁdent inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-ofsample predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently available BMA software.},

	abstract = {Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting often exhibit a spread-error correlation, but they tend to be underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models’ relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members; this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution.},

	abstract = {We wrote this book to introduce graduate students and research workers in various scienti?c disciplines to the use of information-theoretic approaches in the analysis of empirical data. These methods allow the data-based selection of a “best” model and a ranking and weighting of the remaining models in a pre-de?ned set. Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the ?rst e- tion.},

A comprehensive documentation of the differences in the single and multi-model performance in the DEMETER hindcast data set is given. Both deterministic and probabilistic diagnostics are used and a variety of analyses demonstrate the improvements achieved by using multi-model instead of single-model ensembles. In order to understand the reason behind the multi-model superiority, basic scenarios describing how the multi-model approach can improve over single-model skill are discussed. It is demonstrated that multi-model superiority is caused not only by error compensation but in particular by its greater consistency and reliability.},

	abstract = {This review provides a summary of work in the area of ensemble forecasts for weather, climate, oceans, and hurricanes. This includes a combination of multiple forecast model results that does not dwell on the ensemble mean but uses a unique collective bias reduction procedure. A theoretical framework for this procedure is provided, utilizing a suite of models that is constructed from the well-known Lorenz low-order nonlinear system. A tutorial that includes a walk-through table and illustrates the inner workings of the multimodel superensemble’s principle is provided. Systematic errors in a single deterministic model arise from a host of features that range from the model’s initial state (data assimilation), resolution, representation of physics, dynamics, and ocean processes, local aspects of orography, water bodies, and details of the land surface. Models, in their diversity of representation of such features, end up leaving unique signatures of systematic errors. The multimodel superensemble utilizes as many as 10 million weights to take into account the bias errors arising from these diverse features of multimodels. The design of a single deterministic forecast models that utilizes multiple features from the use of the large volume of weights is provided here. This has led to a better understanding of the error growths and the collective bias reductions for several of the physical parameterizations within diverse models, such as cumulus convection, planetary boundary layer physics, and radiative transfer. A number of examples for weather, seasonal climate, hurricanes and sub surface oceanic forecast skills of member models, the ensemble mean, and the superensemble are provided.},
