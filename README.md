The Working Group on Multispecies Assessment Methods (WGSAM) Terms of Reference (ToRs) aims at enabling research on predator-prey interactions for developing advice on the ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

WGSAM, covers both model development and integration into practical management advice, comprises experts from different regions experienced in various modelling techniques (including age-structured, age- and length-structured, size spectra, and foodweb models) who contribute to:

* defining standards for models needed to advise on the management implications of multispecies interaction
* identifying and promoting the research needed to establish a good understanding of how foodweb and fishery interactions influence one another (in connection with working group WGMIXFISH)
* providing a scientific forum for establishing best practice in multi-species assessment methods through review, evaluation and comparison
* aligning ToR with emerging policy needs to support implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy CFP and MSFD.
